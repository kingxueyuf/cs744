Patient was seen medical staff only.
This was a follow up to check how the patient is doing after the depression medication given two weeks earlier. It looks like the
depression medication is working and the patient has been asked continue the medication. If there is a change in mood or behavior
then the patient must see the physician. At this time, no follow up seems to be necessary.
