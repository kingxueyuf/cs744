Patient was seen medical staff and physician.
The patient was referred by the primary care of the patient. The patient was undergoing physical therapy before and now completed it.
The disorder found through X-ray does not seem to be serious enough to do any major operation. So the patient may continue Physical
Therapy again and see whether it helps. No follow up necessary with Neurosciences until referred back again by the primary care.
